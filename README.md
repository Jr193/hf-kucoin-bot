🚀 High-Frequency Trading Bot (HFT) – KuCoin
📖 Overview

This project is a high-frequency trading (HFT) bot specifically designed to execute ultra-fast orders on KuCoin using WebSockets, CPU optimizations, and advanced asynchronous processing.

🔹 Goal: Minimize latency to execute trades within milliseconds after receiving market prices.
🔹 Core Tech: asyncio, websockets, uvloop, KuCoin HFT API, CPU optimization.

⚠ Source code is not publicly available for security reasons, but here is a detailed overview of how it works and what it can achieve.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python (Automation & Algorithmic Trading)

KuCoin API (HFT order handling & real-time price feeds)

Asyncio & Uvloop (Ultra-fast async execution)

WebSockets (Live connection to market prices)

HMAC & hashlib (Secure API request signing)

Aiohttp (Non-blocking API calls for latency reduction)

PSUTIL (CPU optimization & performance management)

⚡ Key Optimizations
✅ Ultra-Low Latency

Real-time price retrieval via WebSockets

Millisecond-level order execution after receiving price updates

✅ CPU & Performance Optimization

uvloop to boost asyncio performance

CPU tuning (multi-core assignment for speed)

Disabled network delays (TCP_NODELAY) for ultra-fast requests

✅ Advanced Security

HMAC-SHA256 request signing

Secure API key management with hashing

No sensitive data stored in plain text

🔑 Core Features

Ultra-fast WebSocket connection to KuCoin

Instant retrieval of live market prices

Execution of HFT limit orders after receiving price updates

Dynamic price rounding (matching KuCoin increments)

Error handling & automatic recovery

📊 Trading Strategy

This bot implements a scalping strategy — taking ultra-fast positions based on live market conditions.

📈 How It Works

1️⃣ Connect to KuCoin WebSocket → Listen to live prices
2️⃣ On price event → Compute limit order with dynamic offset
3️⃣ Execute instant HFT order based on real-time price
4️⃣ Stop bot once order is executed or on failure

🔄 Order Optimization

Dynamic offset applied to entry price

Rounding logic for KuCoin increments

Orders validated & secured by the exchange before execution

🏛 Bot Architecture

📌 Live WebSocket connection to KuCoin
📌 Instant market price retrieval
📌 Advanced async & CPU optimizations
📌 High-Frequency order execution with uvloop
📌 Secure API handling with HMAC
📌 Auto error handling & recovery

💡 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ Extreme Performance: Executes trades in under 1 second
✅ High-Frequency Trading: Compatible with KuCoin HFT API
✅ Optimization & Security: asyncio, uvloop, HMAC, WebSockets
✅ Showcases Expertise in financial bot development
